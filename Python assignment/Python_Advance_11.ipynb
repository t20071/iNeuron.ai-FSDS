A metaclass can also modify a class, but it does so when the class is created. Both can be used to add methods or attributes to a class, but metaclasses provide more control over the class creation process."

    "> Metaclasses, on the other hand, can affect instances indirectly by modifying the class. For example, a metaclass can add methods to a class that then influence how instances of that class behave. So, while decorators modify the class in a straightforward way, metaclasses provide a more powerful and flexible way to change both the class and, consequently, its instances."
